Graphite offers a number of opportunities for students to contribute by building a self-contained project as part of a structured format. These projects are designed to be completed over several months and are ideal for Google Summer of Code or similar internship programs, solo or group university capstone projects, or other arrangements. Each project has a distinct focus and is a great way to make a meaningful contribution to open source over the length of the program while receiving mentorship and guidance from the Graphite team. Student projects require adherence to a set schedule with regular check-ins, milestones, and evaluations.

The structured setting is designed to provide a supportive environment for students to learn and grow as developers while gaining real-world industry experience from collaborating on a sizable software product and remaining accountable to stakeholders.

To date, three student project experiences have been completed successfully. [See below](#successful-past-projects) for summaries to get a feel for what has worked before.

Reach out through [Discord](https://discord.graphite.rs) (preferred) or [by email](/contact) to discuss and propose a project.

## Google Summer of Code

GSoC is a program offering students a stipend for successful completion of an internship-style experience with an open source organization. Read about [how it works](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/). Graphite intends to participate as a mentoring organization in GSoC 2024, pending acceptance.

### GSoC Proposals

Writing a good proposal is an important first step that demonstrates your understanding of the project and your ability to plan and execute it. A well-defined proposal will set you up for success throughout the rest of the program.

You are encouraged to reference the project idea list below to find several potential projects suited to your experience, interest, and choice of scope. Then, we highly recommend reaching out to a core team member through Discord to discuss your plan in detail before writing a proposal. This will help you understand the project's scope and requirements, and it will help us understand your background and capabilities to offer you feedback and suggestions for the best outcome.
